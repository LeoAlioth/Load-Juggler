"""Load Juggler - config-flow helpers: validation, ordering and discovery.

The module-level utilities the flow steps lean on, none of them bound to a flow
instance: the unit sets a form may offer (one declaration, shared with the
readers), the entity-unit and forecast-device validators, the optional-entity
key groups and the normalizers that clear them, entity auto-detection,
entry-title composition, the controlled-device and
priority-order helpers behind the priority page, the two OCPP probes the
charger wizard asks the charger, and the hub phase count derived from the
configured grid CTs. The OCPP registry scan itself lives in the package-root
``ocpp_discovery.py``, where the engine can reach it too.

Anything both handlers need lives here rather than on either of them - the
unit maps below are the create/options twins' single shared declaration, and
that is what lets the create flow and the options flow stay unaware of each
other's handler class.
