# (2026-09-08), a permit chasing a 0 -> 2 400 W swing needed 104 s at 0.1 A/s
# while the surplus turned over in 75 s, so the limiter was saturated the whole
# time and the load absorbed 719 W less than was available, on average.
#
# Closing a FRACTION instead is fast when far from target and gentle near it -
# the adaptive behaviour a constant rate cannot give - and because the step
# always shrinks as the error shrinks it cannot overshoot. Cascaded with the
# EMA above it stays overdamped, so this buys tracking without reintroducing
# the ring the floors were there to damp.
# 0.15/s measured best on the rig's moving-surplus test: mean tracking error
# fell 719 -> 596 W against the old constant slew, with register writes
# unchanged (3.2 -> 3.6 per minute). Raising it to 0.4/s made the error WORSE
# (668 W), which is the useful result - past ~0.15/s this stage stops being the
# bottleneck and the measurement chain upstream (the CT lag plus the engine's
# own grid EMA) dominates. Tuning this number further buys nothing; closing the
# remaining gap would need feed-forward from the solar reading rather than a
# faster follower.
#
# Expressed as a TIME CONSTANT rather than that per-second fraction, for the
# reason the two EMAs were converted before it: a fraction multiplied by the
# refresh interval is a per-CYCLE quantity wearing per-second clothes, and it
# made the refresh rate a control-loop tuning knob. It hid behind the 0.9 cap -
# past a ~6 s interval every site closed 90% of its error per cycle, so a 10 s
# site ramped with tau ~4.3 s where a 1 s site used tau ~6.2 s, and the 10 s
# site tracked BETTER for a reason nothing in the UI explained (rig, 2026-09-08:
# 717 W against 832 W).
#
# 5.6 s is the same number as EMA_TAU_S, and deliberately a SEPARATE constant:
# it is derived independently - the old 0.15/s over the 2 s default closes 0.30
# of the error, and tau = -2 / ln(1 - 0.30) = 5.6 s, which also keeps
# default-configured sites bit-identical - and the ramp and the input filter
# are different design decisions that should be retunable apart. The measured
# optimum was tau ~6.2 s (0.15/s at 1 s), well inside the rig's resolution.
RAMP_TAU_S = 5.6
# The PERMIT filter's own time constant. `apply_smoothing`'s EMA is the second
# exponential lag on the same signal: its input is the engine's answer, which
# was already computed from readings smoothed at EMA_TAU_S. The first guess was
# that it should be SHORTER than the input filter - a second 5.6 s buys no
# further noise rejection and costs another 5.6 s of phase - and the rig says
# the opposite (below): what it is for is damping the loop, not the noise.
#
# Measured on the rig (2026-09-08), and this is the failure a matched 5.6 s
# caused rather than a preference: the ramp's proportional term never engaged
# at all. It closes `|delta| * approach` where delta is the distance to the
# SMOOTHED target, and the matched filter held that within 140 W of where the
# ramp already stood, so `max(floor, proportional)` chose the floor every
# cycle. The permit rose in near-constant 115 W steps (0.1 A/s, exactly
# RAMP_UP_RATE) while the real error was 600 W, and the adaptive rate that was
# added to fix constant-slew tracking was doing nothing.
#
# The same lag holds the permit UP after a surplus falls: export dipped to
# 9 147 W against an 11 000 W limit while the station drew 2 392 W against a
# 1 527 W ideal.
#
# The real fault was in the rate limiter, not here: it took its proportional
# step from the distance to the SMOOTHED target, which this filter holds inside
# the fixed floor, so the adaptive step was frequently not the binding one.
# With the limiter reading the raw error instead, the loop moves faster and
# then needs MORE damping here, not less.
#
# 7 s is the shortest value clear of the ring, measured on the rig
# (dev/ha-test, 2026-09-24: 1 s site refresh, the station's register written
# every 5 s, CTs 5-10 s behind, curtailment on). Each value was run cold from a
# Home Assistant restart, changing nothing else: solar held flat at 14.7 kW
# (register peak-to-peak per 30 s window, mean of the second half, per run), a
# step from 800 to 2 000 W of surplus (overshoot above where it settled), and

#
# Up to 2 s every run rang, indefinitely, on a dead-flat input - and tracked
# better on the averages BECAUSE it rang, since mean-|error| rewards a ring
# centred on the right answer over an honest lag. 3 and 5 s ring in some runs
# and not in others, and 4 s, clean in its two, sits between them: a loop at
# the edge of its margin. 7 s never rang, and what 4-5 s would buy for that
# risk is small: tracking no better (530 and 509 against 533 W, run-to-run
# standard deviation 14-34 W), 15 W less curtailed, and no faster rise (44-48 s
# against 47 s to 90% of the step). 10 s costs 120 W of tracking and 40 W of
# curtailment. 6 s was not run: half of the 15 W is below what three to six
# runs resolve. Register writes were 7-8 per minute at every value.
#
# The FIRST choice of 7 s (2026-09-08) was right for a reason that was not. It
# stood on a sweep of dev/tests/dynamics.py that subtracted the managed draw
# RAW while production smoothed it, so the ~1 kW ring that sweep showed up to
# 4 s came from the harness, not the loop (79dc691 reproduces it byte for byte
# from the raw draw), and on rig runs made while production advanced that
# smoothing twice a cycle (until 4cbbdd1). Closed through the production cycle,
# the harness rings only at 1 s and tracks best at 1.5 s; the rig rings at
# 1.5 s. The ring comes from two things the harness does not model: the rig's
# station has no AC output sensor, so it is booked at its COMMANDED speed
# (load_builders' fallback) while the CTs see the real draw 5-10 s later, and
# its register moves every 5 s, not every cycle. A copy of dynamics.Sim given
# both rings 140-330 W at 1-3 s and under one register step at 7 s, as the rig
# does; given the timing alone it does not ring at all. A station read through
# both AC sensors lacks the first, but a charger whose readout is judged stuck
# is also controlled on its command, so the value has to hold for that loop.
# Only the rig's 1 s refresh was measured; the harness finds 7 s ring-free at
# 2, 5 and 10 s as well, which is weaker evidence, since it misses this ring at
# 1 s too.
#
# It is deliberately no longer equal to EMA_TAU_S. The two are cascaded on one
# signal, so they are not the same design decision: the input filter answers
# how noisy the readings are, this one answers how much phase the loop can
# afford. Their sharing a value was a coincidence of derivation, not a
# constraint - and holding them equal is what made the first attempt look like
# a choice between filtering and tracking.
PERMIT_TAU_S = 7.0
# There is deliberately NO cap on the approach fraction. There was one
# (RAMP_APPROACH_MAX = 0.9, "never close more than this much of the error in
# one cycle"), which read as a safety rail and was not one: the step it bounds
# is PROPORTIONAL to the error with no integral term, so closing the whole
# error lands exactly on target and cannot overshoot. Arithmetically it only
# bound above ~12.9 s, the cadence where ema_alpha_for(dt, RAMP_TAU_S) first
# exceeds 0.9, so at every cadence anyone had measured it was dead code. Run
# at the cadences where it DID bind (15 / 30 / 60 s, dev/tests/dynamics.py)
# removing it left tracking, curtailment, ring and writes identical at 15 and
# 60 s and improved mean tracking error by 3.8 W at 30 s. What actually bounds
# a step is RAMP_UP_RATE / RAMP_DOWN_RATE below, which are in amps per second
# and so mean the same thing at any cadence.

# EMA smoothing - exponential moving average on engine output before rate
# limiting.
#
# The EMA's time constant, in SECONDS. It replaced ``EMA_ALPHA = 0.3``, a
# weight per CALL, which made the filter's speed a hidden function of how often
# the site refreshes: tau = interval / alpha. At the 2 s default that is ~6.7 s,
# but a site polled every 60 s to be kind to its inverter's Modbus silently
# gets tau ~200 s - longer than a cloud takes to pass, so every control loop
# on it is detuned by a setting that says nothing about filtering.
#
# Measured on the rig (2026-09-08) by changing NOTHING but the refresh: mean
# tracking error on a moving surplus went 596 W at 1 s to 1 164 W at 10 s.
#
# Chosen so that at DEFAULT_SITE_UPDATE_FREQUENCY (2 s) the effective weight is
# exactly the 0.3 it replaced, leaving default-configured sites bit-identical:
#     tau = -2 / ln(1 - 0.3) = 5.6 s
# A first-order low-pass has a single REAL pole, so moving its time constant
# can never make that pole complex - no value of tau can introduce oscillation.
# That is what makes this safe to speed up, unlike an integral term.
