"""Portable power station constants - a modulating battery-charging load.

A portable power station (EcoFlow Delta and similar, via a local integration
such as ha-ef-ble) exposes two knobs, and the device type uses both:

- **AC charging speed** (W) - the rate ceiling. The engine's allocation is
  written here, so the station modulates like an EVSE.
- **Backup reserve** (%) - in the station's self-powered mode this is both the
  SOC it grid-charges *up to* and the floor it discharges *down to*. It is
  therefore the real on/off gate: with the reserve below the current battery
  level the station draws nothing from the wall and instead serves its own
  loads from its battery, spending what it stored.

The rate knob cannot express "stop" - a station with a 200 W minimum charge
speed has no zero - so the reserve is what turns charging off. resolve_station_reserve()
owns that decision; the engine only decides how much power the station may take.

Whatever is plugged *into* the station passes through to its outputs and is not
ours to control, so only the charging component counts as this load's managed
draw: ``ac_input_power - ac_output_power``, with the commanded speed as a
fallback when those sensors are missing.
