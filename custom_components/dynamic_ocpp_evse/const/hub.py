#  2. the charge cap's SOC gate is a band this wide - it engages this far below
#     the ceiling and releases only twice this far below it, so an integer SOC
#     tick at either threshold cannot flap the cap (and its register writes);
#  3. the yield-to-Excess latch at the battery's DESTINATION is the same shape:
#     it engages exactly at the destination (below it the battery is served
#     first, never a percent early) and releases only this far below, because
#     the crossing moves the advice by whole kilowatts and an integer SOC
#     register would otherwise sit on the boundary and flip it.
