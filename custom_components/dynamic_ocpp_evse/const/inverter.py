"""Inverter entry constants - battery charge and SOC write-control.

The PV clipping forecast produces two recommendations per battery: a *charge
limit* (``forecast_charge_limit_w``) - how fast this battery may fill so the
midday production peak still has somewhere to go instead of being clipped at
the export limit - and a *max SOC* (``forecast_battery_max_soc``), the ceiling
that leaves exactly that much headroom. These keys turn either recommendation
into an actual write to the inverter.

The two controls are separate because the registers behind them are shaped
differently. The charge RATE is one register that every hybrid exposes (Deye:
maximum battery charge current), so it is one entity. The SOC ceiling on a Deye
is not a register at all - it lives in the *time-of-use slots*, six `number`
entities that each carry their own "charge up to %", so that control fans one
value out across as many entities as the user names. Neither replaces the
other: slowing the fill is gentler, a ceiling is absolute, and a site may arm
one, both or neither.

Everything here is optional. With no target entity configured, the inverter
entry stays advisory - exactly as before write-control existed.

# A recommendation of 0 is legitimate: solar below the export threshold with the
# battery already at the reserved ceiling - or simply parked at its destination
# on a day that reserves nothing - means "do not add any more". Written as
# a hard 0 the battery stops charging entirely, so it keeps serving the house
# instead and the SOC sags - until the latch releases and the inverter recharges
# at full rate, which is a sawtooth rather than a hold. A couple of amps is
# enough for the battery to trickle back the house draw and hug the ceiling.
#
# 0 (the default) is exactly the behaviour that existed before this knob: the
# recommendation is applied as-is. It is a device-protection floor and not
# forecast policy - the published advice sensors stay unclamped.

#
# The interval is DIRECTIONAL for the charge rate (see ``control/inverter.py``):
# it is how long a REDUCTION must hold before it is written, since the engaged

# should follow. A rise is not paced by it at all (it is bounded to one Excess
# trigger margin per write instead), and the cap engaging bypasses it as the
# protective transition it is. For the RELEASE ramp, and for the SOC ceiling
# control, it stays a plain minimum time between writes.
#
# The key is unchanged from when this was a symmetric write interval, so no
# stored value migrates: 300 s means the same 300 s, applied to the direction

# --- Battery SOC ceiling control ---------------------------------------------
#
# The SOC twin of the charge-rate control above, and deliberately a LIST of
# target entities: on a Deye the ceiling is expressed per time-of-use slot, so
# holding the battery at 80 % means writing 80 to every slot the battery may
# charge in. One value, N entities - a single-entity field would silently
# control a sixth of the day.
CONF_SOC_LIMIT_ENTITY_IDS = "inverter_soc_limit_entity_ids"

# Where the "normal" ceiling comes from while the forecast is not holding the
# battery back. An entity rather than a stored number, so whatever already owns
# the slots - a seasonal automation, a cheap-tariff schedule, the user's own
# input_number - keeps owning them: we only ever push it DOWN (see the min() in
# control/inverter.py), and a change to this entity propagates on the next
# cycle. Unconfigured, or configured and unreadable, is not a guess: the
# constant below stands in for the first, and the second defers all writes.

# What a WRITE to the inverter's SOC entities MEANS - and only a write. This
# flag never decides where the pack should go: the destination is always read
# from CONF_SOC_LIMIT_NORMAL_ENTITY_ID when that is set, whatever the hardware
# calls the register (see engine/readers.py). A floor register whose value is
# NOT the owner's charge target simply leaves the source unset and anchors at
# 100 % - that knob already existed, and the flag must not duplicate it.
#
# The distinction it does carry is what the SOC fan-out may put into the slots.
# A genuine ceiling register takes "stop charging at N %", so tracking
# min(source, recommendation) unconditionally is the whole point. A Deye slot
# SOC is a DISCHARGE FLOOR plus grid-charge target: the same number tells the
# inverter "grid-charge to N % and never discharge below it" - so holding the
# slots at the destination all night blocks self-consumption and imports toward
# it (observed live 2026-08-25). Under floor semantics the fan-out therefore
# writes only in each state's safe direction (a reservation may only lower a
# slot, tracking the source may only raise one back), and refuses to write at
# all without a configured source that is not itself a managed slot - see
# ``send_inverter_soc_limit``.
#
# The common floor site (a Deye whose one slot value is both the overnight
# floor and the owner's charge target) points the ceiling SOURCE at the slot:
# the reserve is carved below that number, the pack parks there on ordinary
# days, and the band above it stays the export-holding buffer that
# ``recommended_charge_limit``'s engaged feedback fills only while export sits
# over the setpoint.
