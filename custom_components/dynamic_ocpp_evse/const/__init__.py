"""Constants for the Dynamic OCPP EVSE integration.

Split into per-area modules; this aggregator re-exports every name so
``from .const import *`` and ``from .const import (NAMES)`` keep working
unchanged. ``common.py`` is the leaf (no sibling imports) and is imported
first, since the per-device modules pull the shared ``OperatingMode`` class
and ``BEHAVIOR_*`` constants from it. ``modes.py`` is imported last, as it
aggregates the per-device mode catalogs.
