    The companion to ``resolve_tank_mode_priority``'s surplus demotion below,
    which already drops a boosting tank to the Excess tier. That moved the
    tank's URGENCY but not its behavior: Freeze Protection and Normal both map
    to ``BEHAVIOR_FULL_POWER``, whose whole body is ``return max_current``, so a
    boosting tank took its element's full rating from the physical pool however
    little surplus existed. It claimed against the Excess ledger - reducing what
    lower-ranked loads were offered - while never being subject to the pool
    itself (measured live 2026-09-07: a 74 W margin, a 2 kW element, and the
    station behind it starved). True here, the caller reads
    ``BEHAVIOR_BINARY_EXCESS`` instead: still all-or-nothing at the full
    rating, but gated on the surplus actually existing.

    THE FLOOR GUARD IS THE POINT. ``resolve_tank_setpoint`` returns "boost" on
    the surplus verdict alone, with NO temperature test - so a tank at 25 °C
    with the verdict on is labelled "boost" too. Gating that on the pool would
    deny power to a FROST-PROTECTION element. So the boost only counts as
    opportunistic once the tank has already reached the temperature its mode
    actually asks for: away for Freeze Protection, normal for Normal. Below
    that it keeps full power, unconditionally.

    An unknown temperature reads as NOT opportunistic, deliberately: a missing
    reading must never be what gates a must-run element.

    Solar Priority is absent on purpose - it is ``BEHAVIOR_SOLAR_PRIORITY``
    already, and its boost is SOC-driven rather than surplus-driven.

       solar-priority loads when power is contended. Only the tier changes; the

       solar + above-minimum battery and never deep-cycles the bank below its

    2. Surplus demotion - a tank aiming at its *boost* setpoint is heating past
       the temperature its mode actually asks for, on energy the site would
       otherwise dump. That is opportunistic, so it drops to the Excess tier and
       yields the wire to every must-run load. A cold tank (1) keeps its
