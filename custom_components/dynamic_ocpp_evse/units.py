"""Entity-read handling - the one place that knows A/mA/W/kW/V/mV, and the one
place that decides whether a reading is usable at all.

Every physical value Load Juggler reads comes from someone else's integration,
in whatever unit that integration felt like publishing. The config flow is
deliberately permissive about this (a meter's signed power entity is often the
only usable choice for a "current" field, see CONF_PHASE_*_CURRENT_ENTITY_ID),
so the conversion has to be right at every read site.

It used to be spread out: the old ``_read_entity(unit="A")`` contract said
"W → A conversion requires voltage - caller must handle this", and each reader
reimplemented it. The grid-phase reader never did, so a 1300 W meter reading
was treated as 1300 A and multiplied by voltage again - 300 kW of phantom grid
power. Hence one module, pure functions, and an exhaustive test matrix.

``ENTITY_UNIT_CONTRACTS`` below is the declaration the config flow validates
against and the tests hold us to: every unit a field accepts must be a unit
some converter here can actually turn into that field's canonical domain.

``is_unavailable`` / ``is_unusable_number`` are here for the same reason the
converters are: "is this sensor reading usable?" used to be hand-rolled at a
dozen read sites with five different answers, and the safety-relevant one
(the grid CTs) had the loosest. The module stays importable without Home
Assistant - state objects are duck-typed, only ``.state`` is touched - so the
pure test tier can hold these to their contract.
