"""Inverter battery write-control - charge rate, and the SOC ceiling.

The clipping forecast says how fast this battery may fill so the midday peak
still has somewhere to go. This module turns that number into a write to the
inverter's own charge-limit register (Deye: maximum battery charge current).

Four rules shape it, and all four exist because the target is a Modbus
register rather than a software knob:

1. **Opt-in.** Nothing is written until the user turns the inverter's Battery
   Charge Control switch on. A mis-picked entity should be harmless.
2. **Paced DIRECTIONALLY** (:func:`down_window_value`). The advice is now
   memoryless direct feedback (see ``calculations.forecast``), so it moves with
   the plant every cycle and the pacing is where the volatility is absorbed -
   asymmetrically, because the two directions cost different things:

   * **Upward** - eligible on every site cycle. A rise is a permission to
     refill, it is already bounded to one Excess trigger margin per write by
     rule 3, and it is the direction the masked-site self-creep escapes in
     (one margin per cycle). Nothing waits for a clock.
   * **Downward** - a reduction must PERSIST for a whole window before it is
     written, and the window is ``CONF_CHARGE_CONTROL_INTERVAL`` (300 s by
     default). Every sample in the window must agree that the register is too
     high, and the value written is the window's MAXIMUM - the least reduction
     all of them agree on, so the instant the window fills cannot pick a
     momentary dip. Any sample back at the register clears the window: the
     reduction did not persist. This is what a kettle, a passing cloud or a car
     plugging in runs into, and it is why they cost no register traffic.
   * **Exempt** - the cycle the forecast's charge gate ENGAGES (``limiting``
     False → True: the destination hold or the reservation taking hold) writes
     down at once. That is a protective regime transition, not a steady-state
     correction, and only steady-state corrections are made lazy.
   * **Never the same value twice in an interval** - for an interval after a
     write, the register is taken to hold what we wrote rather than what it
     reads back, so a register slow to report a write, or one that clamps or
     refuses it, gets one retry per interval instead of a write per cycle.

   Some firmwares commit these registers to EEPROM, and the measured cost of
   the whole arrangement is ~54 writes a day against the ~31 of the design it
   replaced - for ~62 Wh of curtailment a cloudy household day instead of
   ~370 Wh.
3. **Slew-limited upward, instant downward** (:func:`slew_limited`). Lowering
   the limit is the protection direction and lands in one write. Raising it is
   a permission to refill, and the written value may climb by at most one
   Excess trigger margin's worth of watts per write - because a battery handed
   its full rate in a single step drinks the whole clipping reserve out of
   exportable power in minutes, which is the reserve's own purpose reversed.
4. **Restored, once it gets there.** When the advice releases - evening, no
   clipping expected - the normal value is the ramp's destination rather than
   its first step: each write climbs by the slew step, and only when the ramp
   lands does the applied-state marker clear, so a released limit stops being
   written for the rest of the night. That unwind keeps the interval as a plain
   minimum time between writes - it is not a steady-state correction being
   paced, it is a finite ramp with somewhere to arrive, and the reserve it is
   handing back is exactly what a faster ramp would spend. Switching the
   control OFF is the one restore that is still a single write: while disarmed
   we are not entitled to go on writing the register at all, so the unwind
   cannot be spread over a ramp we would have no standing to finish.

One optional clamp sits on top of them: a configured **minimum charge limit**
(:func:`resolve_minimum_value`) is the lowest value ever written while the
advice is engaged. It exists because a hard 0 stops the battery charging
altogether, so the pack starts serving the house and drifts down off the ceiling
the advice was holding it at. Engaged writes only - a release restores full rate
and can never be "too low" - and nothing upstream is affected: the forecast's
own numbers, and the sensors publishing them, stay unclamped.

Single reader, too. The register is read back once per call - before any branch,
so the paced-out calls and the release path read it as well - both to compare
against what we are about to write and to be republished as the charge-control
sensor's own numeric state. That sensor therefore measures the register without
ever touching it: everything it reports comes from the runtime dict this module
records (``INVERTER_RT_*``).

That same read-back has a second consumer, and it is not a sensor: while the
limit is engaged, the register value is *the rate the battery is permitted to
take*, so it is republished in watts as ``INVERTER_RT_ENFORCED_CHARGE_W`` for
the calculation engine - which narrows the Excess verdict's battery charge
allowance to it instead of the configured nameplate rate (see
``engine/fleet.charge_power_total``). A clipping window is exactly when the site
has surplus it cannot place, so the verdict must not go on counting a charge
rate this module is actively forbidding. None means nothing is being held back.

Single writer: the one caller is the inverter's charge-control sensor, which the
hub coordinator awaits once per site cycle as a site-cycle worker (see
``entities/inverter.py``). Nothing else - no poll, no service call - may write
this register, which is what makes "one write in flight at a time" true. The
pacing above is measured in wall-clock seconds (``now_mono``), never in cycles,
so the site's cadence changes how often the *check* runs and not how often the
register is actually written.

The second half of the module is the **SOC ceiling** control
(``send_inverter_soc_limit``). Same three rules - opt-in via its own switch,
paced, and driven by exactly one site-cycle worker (its own sensor, so that a
site which configures the SOC ceiling and no charge-current register still gets
a tick; the coordinator awaits its workers one at a time, so a single write in
flight holds across both) - and two differences that come straight from the
hardware:

* **It fans out.** On a Deye the ceiling is not one register but one per
  time-of-use slot, so the target is a *list* of entities and the deadband is
  applied per entity: each slot is read back and skipped on its own.
* **It never restores anything.** The value written is always
  ``min(normal, recommendation)``, where ``normal`` is a live entity the user's
  own automations keep owning. There is no applied-state marker and no release
  write: as the advice self-heals to 100 % through the afternoon the min() hands
  the slots straight back, and while no advice exists the control simply tracks
  the normal entity. That is why the charge-rate control's "restored exactly
  once" rule has no twin here - there is no state to unwind.

Under FLOOR semantics (``CONF_SOC_LIMIT_SEMANTICS``) the same memoryless value
is written, but only in each state's own safe direction: a reservation
(desired below the normal) may only LOWER a slot - on a floor register that
write means "the house may drain to here", the just-in-time pre-clip drop -
and tracking the normal may only RAISE one back toward the source value. The
two cross-cases are both harm on a floor register (raising defends charge the
owner never asked defended, and on a Deye grid-charges toward it; lowering an
owner-raised slot drops protection they set by hand), so they are skipped.
Because raising stops at the source and lowering at the recommendation, the
release still needs no memory: the slots we dropped overnight climb back to
the source in one deadband-gated write when the advice self-heals. Floor
writes also carry two hard prerequisites - a configured normal source (the
100-default written into a floor register would mean "never discharge"), and
that source must not itself be one of the managed slots (writing the reserve
into it would drag the destination, and the restore anchor, down with it).

    instead. ``previous_applied`` covers the case where the register cannot be
    read back at all.

    DIRECTIONAL, for the same reason the pacing is. The configured deadband is a
    percentage of the NORMAL value, which is the right scale for a reduction -
    that is where register churn costs something, and the persistence window
    already gates those. It is the wrong scale for a rise: while the limit is
