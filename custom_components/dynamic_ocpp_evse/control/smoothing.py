    the EMA per CYCLE instead coupled the two, and the coupling was invisible:
    at the 60 s interval a slow inverter needs, the permit filter carried a

        # the SMOOTHED target, and the filter above holds that inside the fixed
        # floor, so ``max(floor, proportional)`` chose the floor on every cycle
        # of every site. The permit climbed in near-constant 115 W steps
        # (0.1 A/s, exactly RAMP_UP_RATE) while the real error was 600 W - the
        # adaptive rate was measured as an improvement while never once
        # engaging.
        #
        # Taking it of the raw error cannot overshoot, which is what makes it
        # safe: the step stays bounded by ``delta`` in the comparisons below,
        # so the permit still moves only as far as the smoothed target. A
        # bigger allowance lets it stop being throttled SHORT of that target,
        # never past it, so the OUTPUT is never less filtered than the EMA.
        # That is the difference from shortening PERMIT_TAU_S, which bought the
        # same speed by removing the filter itself and turned a decaying
        # transient into a sustained 600 W ring on a dead-flat input.
