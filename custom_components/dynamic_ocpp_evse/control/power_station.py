"""Portable power station control - charge speed and backup reserve.

Two writes per command cycle, and the interesting one is the reserve. The
station's charge-speed knob has no zero (200 W is its floor), so "stop
charging" cannot be expressed as a rate. What stops it is the backup reserve:
below the current battery level the station draws nothing from the wall and
serves its own loads from its battery instead.

So the engine's allocation sets *how fast*, and the reserve sets *whether*.
