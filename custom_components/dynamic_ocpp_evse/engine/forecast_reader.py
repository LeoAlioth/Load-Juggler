"""Read solar forecast series from HA entities for the PV clipping maths.

The pure maths lives in ``calculations/forecast.py`` and takes plain
timezone-aware datetimes. This module is the HA-touching side: it reads the
``watts`` attribute the Open-Meteo Solar Forecast sensors expose (a mapping of
block-start timestamps to average watts), parses and validates it, and sums
the per-array series into one site series. It is also the only place timezone
handling lives - every horizon boundary is a local midnight, so one day's peak
is never reserved for twice (``forecast_windows``).

Fail open by design: an unreadable entity or attribute contributes nothing,
which flows through to "nothing to clip" → SOC ceiling 100 % → charge cap
released. A dropped sensor must never clamp the battery; visibility comes from
the hub Status sensor, which names unavailable forecast entities.

    '''``(raw, inflated, by_entity)`` - both site series, and their parts.

    Two series out of ONE read, because the two consumers want different
    numbers from the same forecast. The clip integral may be biased optimistic
    per array (a learned gain, once the observers earn one); the deadline
    (``first_production_at``) must not be, since it already carries its own
    early bias. Reading twice would double the parse and could straddle a
    forecast update, so the per-array series are kept and merged twice instead.

    ``inflation_by_entity`` maps a forecast entity to its inverter's percent.
    Falsy, or all zeros, returns the SAME object for both - so a site with
    nothing configured takes exactly the path it took before this existed.

    The third element is the per-entity map the merges were built from. The
    gain observer needs it to split the site forecast back out per inverter
    (each array belongs to one), and rebuilding it there would parse every
    entity a second time.

    The parse is memoized per entity on the State object's identity - HA
    replaces the immutable State on every update, so an unchanged object means
    an unchanged attribute (a timestamp key would miss two updates landing on
    the same clock tick). The attribute holds 48–200 entries and this runs
    every site refresh (default 2 s), while the forecast integration updates a
    few times per hour. A memo, not a fallback cache: a missing or unavailable
    entity contributes nothing (fail open), it does not serve stale data.
