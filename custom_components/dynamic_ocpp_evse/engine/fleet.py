"""Inverter fleet aggregation - many inverter entries, one set of scalars.

A hub may have several inverters (typical: an older AC-coupled string inverter
plus a hybrid with a battery), each an ``inverter`` config entry optionally
carrying its own battery. The distribution engine and ``SiteContext`` stay
single-inverter/single-battery on purpose - this module reduces the fleet to
those scalars, applying the per-member gating that the scalar form cannot
express:

- **Charge power** sums only members whose OWN battery is below its OWN
  full-SOC, and sums the rate each one is PERMITTED to take rather than its
  nameplate rate - our own charge control may be holding that member's register
  below it (see ``charge_power_total``). The fleet passes
  ``battery_soc_full=None`` to SiteContext when
  more than one battery exists, so the calculations-level full gate (which
  only knows the fleet SOC) can never falsely re-zero a partially-full fleet;
  with a single battery the member's real full-SOC is passed through and the
  behavior is exactly the classic single-battery one.
- **Discharge power** sums only members whose OWN battery is at/above the
  hub-level (hysteresis-adjusted) minimum SOC - a battery already below the
  floor cannot be counted dischargeable just because a big full sibling drags
  the weighted fleet SOC above it.
- **Fleet SOC** is capacity-weighted (Σ soc×kWh / Σ kWh); plain mean when no
  member has a known capacity. Hub-level policy (SOC target/min sliders,
  their hysteresis latches) applies to this one number.
- **Solar** sums per member: its own production sensor when configured,
  otherwise derived from its inverter output - a parallel member's output is
  production; a series member's output carries its battery flow, so its
  production is ``output − its battery power`` (off-grid on either wiring -
  see ``member_solar``). Applied to the summed outputs
  with the summed battery power, the series formula is algebraically exact
  for ANY mix, because parallel members contribute no battery term.
- **Inverter capacity**: total = Σ; the single per-phase scalar collapses
  conservatively to the minimum over phases of the per-phase sums of the
  members feeding that phase.

Pure functions - unit-testable. Reading HA entities into FleetMember objects
happens in hub_calculation.py, which owns the sensor helpers.

    only when both values are known.

    "Permitted" rather than "rated", per member:
    ``min(charge_cap, enforced_charge_limit)`` while our own Battery Charge
    Control is holding that member's charge register below its nameplate rate,
    and the plain ``charge_cap`` otherwise. This is the allowance the Excess
    verdict compares the site's placed power against
    (``calculations.excess_margin`` - the only consumer of
    ``SiteContext.battery_max_charge_power``), and the whole point of the
    distinction is the clipping window: while the forecast holds the battery at,
    say, 6.5 kW of a 10 kW rating, the missing 3.5 kW is not somewhere the site
    can put its production, so counting it would read the site as having room
    left exactly when it has surplus it cannot place, and Excess loads -
    which exist to soak that surplus up - could never engage.

    Only ENFORCEMENT narrows. An advice-only member (its switch off, so nothing
    is written to the inverter) really does still charge at its nameplate rate,
    so narrowing on the mere existence of an advice would under-report the
    allowance and over-trigger Excess. That distinction arrives already made:
    the control publishes a rate only while it is actually holding one, and
    None otherwise.

    One cycle behind by nature: the register write is performed by a site-cycle
    worker AFTER the result that carries the advice is published, so what any
    cycle can know is what the previous cycle's write enforced. At seconds-scale
    cycles against a forecast that moves over hours, that lag is invisible; and
    the value is the register's own read-back, so it reports what the battery is
    permitted rather than what we intend it to be permitted.
