"""The two forecast observers - accumulate, roll over daily, publish nothing else.

Observe-only by construction: these functions return figures for the engine to
publish and never touch the advice. What they measure, and why each is shaped
the way it is, lives in ``calculations/calibration.py``; this module owns only
the per-cycle bookkeeping that a pure function cannot.

STATE LIVES IN ``hub_runtime`` and is therefore lost on a restart, which is a
deliberate limitation of the observe phase rather than an oversight. The datum
that matters is each DAY's ratio, and that is published as the sensor's own
state, so the recorder keeps the history whatever the process does - the running
average is a convenience on top. Applying a learned gain later needs it to
survive restarts, and that is where ``helpers.storage.Store`` comes in (see
dev/TODO.md); an observer does not.
