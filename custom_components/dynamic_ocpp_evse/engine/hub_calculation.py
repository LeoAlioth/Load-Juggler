    so they have to be on one time basis: the reconstruction answers "what
    would the site export with our loads off", and that answer is only stable
    while both halves move together. With a smoothed grid reading and a raw
    draw, every change in a load's draw moved the reconstruction before the
    grid term caught up - the margin overshot, the permit chased it, and a
    modulating load rang around its target instead of settling (measured on
    the rig, 2026-09-08: a station hunting 299-828 W against a 600 W target,
    seven register writes a minute).

    Callers that work on the RAW grid basis must leave ``ema_inputs`` unset and
    get raw draws, so their pairing stays consistent too -
    ``engine/hub_result.py`` adds draws back to ``raw_phases`` and wants raw
    on both sides.

    add that draw back into the reconstruction - telling the engine the site
