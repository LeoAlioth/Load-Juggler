"""Load Juggler - HA-state edge of the engine: sensor reading and smoothing.

Everything in here is the boundary between Home Assistant's entity states and
the numbers the calculation engine works with: the ``_UNAVAILABLE`` sentinel a
configured-but-unreadable sensor resolves to, ``_read_entity()`` and the
per-domain readers built on it (grid phases, inverter output, inverter and
fleet-member configuration), the EMA smoothing and stale-guard holdover that
decide what an unavailable feed stands in for, and the small debug formatters
that print a reading and its smoothed value side by side.

Split out of hub_calculation.py, which now consumes these readers rather than
defining them; config_flow.py reuses two of them for its live previews.

    Returns ``(resolved_phases, any_stale, assumed_phases)``;
    ``resolved_phases`` holds only floats and Nones, so nothing unusable can
    reach the EMA smoothing, the engine, or the published grid figures.

    Documented failure-mode behaviour, unchanged:
      * a reading we have history for → hold the last known EMA value, which a
        brief dropout then coasts on with no visible effect;
      * no history at all (cold start) → assume the phase is loaded right up to
        the main breaker. Worst case on purpose: it hands out no headroom, where
        the 0 A this used to fall back to handed out all of it.
    The >GRID_STALE_TIMEOUT escalation is the caller's, driven by the
    ``any_stale`` flag through _track_grid_stale.

    ``assumed_phases`` is a per-phase tuple of bools marking ONLY the second
    case - the phases standing on the breaker assumption rather than on a
    reading or a held EMA value. It exists because the two substitutes are
    different kinds of number: a held EMA value is a legitimate estimate of
    what the phase was doing a moment ago and is fine to publish as a
    measurement, whereas the breaker assumption is a fabrication chosen for
    safety, and publishing it paints a 3 x breaker x voltage spike onto the
    grid sensors, the recorder and long-term statistics (issue: cold-start
    failsafe published as a measurement). The publisher (engine/hub_result.py)
    nulls the grid MEASUREMENTS while any phase is flagged; the allocation
    keeps using the assumption, which is what makes it safe. Derived here
    rather than re-tested downstream: this is the one place that knows which
    substitute each phase got.

    Driven by the READINGS, not by a second walk over the config keys. The
    sentinel is the single source of truth for "this CT is unreadable", so there
    is no membership list here that can drift away from the reader's - which is
    what made the old coerce-to-0 arrangement a landmine rather than merely a
    duplication.
