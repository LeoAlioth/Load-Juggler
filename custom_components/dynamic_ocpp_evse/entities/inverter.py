"""Per-inverter entities - sensors on each inverter device.

An inverter config entry is a power source linked to a hub, optionally
carrying its own battery. The engine aggregates the hub's inverter fleet each
cycle and publishes a per-inverter section into hub_data
(``hub_data["inverters"][entry_id]``); these sensors read their own entry's
section, mirroring how circuit-group sensors read ``group_data``.

The charge-control status sensor is also where the write-control loop ticks:
it runs once per site cycle with the entry in hand, so the writes ride the same
clock as the readings that justify them. The SOC-control sensor is the same
shape for the battery SOC ceiling: each write-control is driven by the sensor
that reports it, so a control ticks exactly when its own target is configured,
and the coordinator's one-at-a-time await of its workers is what keeps a single
write in flight.

    """The applied battery charge limit - and the loop that performs the writes.

    A MEASUREMENT of the target register: the value the inverter's charge-limit
    number entity currently holds, in that register's own units (DC amps or
    watts, per ``CONF_CHARGE_LIMIT_UNIT``). That graphs the whole story
    continuously - flat at the normal limit, dipping while the forecast holds the
    battery back, restored on release - and earns long-term statistics, which the
    text state it used to publish ("Limiting to 17.0A") could never do. The
    register is read once per cycle by the control below; None (unknown) when it
    cannot be read at all.

    Our own standing moved to attributes, ``control_state`` first: ``off`` (the
    switch is not armed), ``idle`` (armed, nothing to hold back) or ``limiting``.
    Releasing is a log line rather than a state, since a one-cycle status nobody
    sees is not worth the extra state.

    Its per-cycle work is an AWAIT - a Modbus register write - not a read, so it
    joins the site cycle as a *worker* rather than as a coordinator listener
    (see SiteCycleWorkerMixin). That keeps the writes on the same clock as the
    forecast that produces them, keeps exactly one place talking to the
    inverter's register, and gets the serialization the old platform poll used
    to provide: the coordinator awaits its workers one at a time.

    Still unconditionally available, unlike every reader on this device - and now
    that it does publish a reading, that is a deliberate re-decision rather than
    the old answer carried over. The freshness gate exists because a stale
    *reading* lies: a held 0 W of solar reads as a live 0 W within seconds,
    because solar moves on its own. A charge-limit register does not. It changes
    only when something writes it, and while the control is armed we are the only
    writer - so the last value we read stays factually true for as long as nobody
    writes it, which is exactly the property the gate assumes a reading lacks.
    The failure that does matter here, an unreadable register, is reported in the
    value itself (None → unknown) rather than by blanking the entity, and the
    standing is in ``control_state``, which is honest before the first cycle and
    on a site with no forecast at all. A dead engine is already reported by the
    hub's status sensor and by every gated reader beside this one; a duplicate of
    that signal would cost this sensor the continuity it exists to provide, and
    would blank a live register whenever an unrelated producer went stale.

    The residual: if the site cycle dies, nothing re-reads the register, so the
    last value is held and its statistics flatline until the integration is
    reloaded - visible only as every other sensor on the device going unavailable
    beside it.
