    The async counterpart of :class:`SiteCycleConsumerMixin`. A reader can ride
    a coordinator listener because re-reading a dict is synchronous. An entity
    whose work is an *await* - a Modbus register write, a service call - cannot:
    a listener is a plain callback, so it could only spawn a task per tick and
    then let those tasks race each other on a slow write.

    Such an entity therefore joins the cycle the way a load does

    coordinator walks from inside its own async body. Registration - not a
    coordinator reference - is the whole link, so a worker whose entry is set up
    before its hub's is simply picked up by the next tick, and the entry is
    released with the entity.

    What the coordinator guarantees (``sensor.py: async_run_hub_cycle``):

    * a worker is awaited **after** ``publish_hub_data``, and is handed the
      published result - the same dict this hub's readers see, so a worker can
      never act on a different cycle than the sensors reporting it;
    * the workers of one hub are awaited **sequentially**, so nothing here can
      overlap with itself or with another worker. This is what replaces the
      serialization a platform poll used to provide for free.

    Order *among* workers is insertion order and deliberately not promised: each
    one actuates its own device, so only the serialization matters.
