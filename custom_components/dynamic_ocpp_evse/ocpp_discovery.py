"""Load Juggler - the OCPP registry scan, shared by the flows and the engine.

One derivation of "which OCPP sensors belong to which charge point", reachable
from both sides of the integration:

* the config flow uses it to discover chargers (``scan_ocpp_chargers``) and to
  resolve one picked device-registry device to a charger (``ocpp_charger_for_device``);
* the runtime uses it to find a charger's connector-status sensor.

It lives at the package root rather than under ``config_flow/`` because
``engine/`` may not import the flows - a package-root module next to
``units.py`` / ``helpers.py`` / ``registry.py`` is below both layers, and this
one imports only ``const``, ``helpers`` and the Home Assistant registries, so
neither direction can grow a cycle.

Sensors are grouped by charge point and classified by the ocpp integration's
own metric keys (see ``_ocpp_metric_of``), never by guessing
``sensor.{base name}{suffix}`` off one entity_id. That is what makes a charger
with renamed entity_ids, or one whose per-phase sensors sit on connector
sub-devices, discoverable at all.

Moved here verbatim from ``config_flow/helpers.py``, where it could only be
reached by the flows.
