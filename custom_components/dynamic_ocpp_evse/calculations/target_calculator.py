    the feedback loop does that: it takes each managed draw off the grid
    reading, and wherever solar or the battery was serving the draw it comes
    back as export (``engine/hub_calculation._apply_feedback_loop``). Off-grid
    that loop returns early - no CT reading ever contained the draws - so
    nothing handed them back, and the battery's discharge in flight, which

    the term that hands it back, standing where the export stands grid-tied.

    It is the managed draw the feedback loop would have subtracted - the same
    SMOOTHED figure (``site.managed_phase_draws``), because the pools set it
    against the smoothed battery reading, and a raw draw leads that reading on

    up to 20 A and asked 5.6 kW of the 5 kW battery; on the smoothed draw it
    holds 17.4 A and 5.0 kW from the first command. Without the engine's
    figure (the pure test tier) the loads' own draws stand in, which is the
    same number when nothing is filtered.

    Solar and battery share the same inverter, so per-phase and total inverter limits

    THE IDENTITY every configuration satisfies: what our loads may be offered
    is the supply the site can reach less the household,

        import allowance + solar + usable discharge rating − household,

    and the physical pool reaches it as two halves, BOTH read with our loads
    off (the feedback loop's reconstruction). The grid half is the allowance
    less the import the site would show (``_calculate_grid_limit``). This
    half is the export the site would show plus the battery's headroom:

        export with our loads off + (discharge rating − battery flow)

    - the NET supply the inverters put out beyond the house. By the site's
    energy balance that is solar + rating − household less whatever of the
    house the grid carries, which the grid half has already counted.

    It used to be GROSS - solar + (rating − discharge in flight) - and that
    only lands on the identity where "solar" is itself the export-derived
    figure (no output sensors, no solar sensor: after the feedback loop it is
    export + charge). Everywhere else the inverter's output was counted twice

    dev/tests/test_gridtied_inverter_pool.py). With a dedicated solar sensor or
    a PV inverter's output sensor, the production the house already takes was
    offered again - a 5 kW pool where 4 kW is right, 1 kW over a 0 W import
    allowance, and past the breaker where the breaker binds. On a series
    hybrid read through its output sensor, whose derived solar is output −
    battery, the discharge in flight carries our own loads, so a battery-fed
    car's draw was booked as spent: at a 0 W allowance it was cut and hunted,
    at 2 kW its pool shrank one-for-one with its draw. Off-grid the export is
    the managed draw our loads hold (``_off_grid_held_supply``, which stands
    where the export stands grid-tied) - the same formula, which 8d3553e
    introduced there.

    Signed flow: a charging battery's charge comes back to our loads. Below the
    SOC minimum the rating drops out and the flow in flight still comes off, so
    our loads get the sun's surplus and never the pack.

    With the battery's flow unread the flow term is 0, and grid-tied no
    headroom is offered on the battery's word (``discharge_headroom_unknown``,
    which hub_result shares): the pool is the export the meter measures.
    Off-grid with the flow unread there is no export to start from, and the

    """The load-off reconstruction: ``(export_w, battery_restored_w)``.

    Every figure the Excess verdict decides on is read as the site would read it
    *with our own managed loads off* - that is what makes the number stable
    enough to decide with, since a load that is running must not suppress the
    verdict that engaged it. This is the part of that reconstruction that
    depends on the grid readings, split out because ``excess_margin`` is no
    longer its only consumer: the forecast's charge-limit advice steers on the
    same reconstructed export (see ``engine/hub_result._compute_forecast_advice``).

    Off-grid there are no readings at all, so nothing is reconstructed from
    them: export is 0 and the managed draws are handed back wholesale.
    ``_apply_feedback_loop`` returns early there (the grid readings are
    synthetic zeros that never contained the draws), so without that a load's
    own consumption would come straight out of the battery's charge rate and
    suppress the very margin that engaged it - the verdict would chatter every
    cycle. Adding it back makes each load a probe: drawing power makes a
    curtailing inverter ramp up, and the margin settles at the site's *true*
    surplus, which is otherwise invisible off-grid.

    Grid-tied, ``_apply_feedback_loop`` has already taken the draws off the grid
    readings, which is the load-off state for every watt the inverter served by
    exporting less. What it cannot see is the watt served by CHARGING THE
    BATTERY LESS on a site whose phases are unbalanced: the battery's rate falls
    site-wide while the draw is subtracted from one phase, and on a phase that
    still reads net import the subtraction is clamped at zero instead of showing
    up as export. The margin then dropped the moment the load engaged - the
    on/off cycling of #41.

    So finish the reconstruction the same way the site would: give the freed
    power back to the battery, up to the headroom it actually has, and restore
    the per-phase demand that charging represents. Whatever the battery cannot
    take stays where the feedback loop put it, on the export side. A saturated
    (or full, or absent) battery has no headroom, so nothing moves and this is
    exactly the plain gross reading - and a battery sitting on an enforced
    charge limit is saturated in precisely that sense, which is why narrowing
    the allowance to the enforced rate cannot make the verdict move when a load
    starts: the load's draw was taken off the grid readings, the battery has no
    room to be handed it back, so it stays on the export side and the margin is
    unchanged.

    The export term is GROSS and clamped per phase: an export limit is physical
    and contractual per exported flow, so a site pushing 30 A out on two phases
    while pulling 10 A in on the third is exporting 30 A, not 20 A. Import on
    one phase never buys export headroom on another.

    It is also the PHYSICAL export - every watt at the meter, whatever produced
    it. The Excess verdict wants only the SOLAR share and nets the battery's
    discharge off this figure itself (see ``excess_margin``); the charge-limit
    advice wants the physical number, because the meter is the plant it steers,
    and it handles a discharging pack in its own arithmetic instead (the
    battery term goes negative, and a charge cap cannot force a discharge - see
    ``calculations.recommended_charge_limit``). Two consumers, one
    reconstruction, and the mode-dependent part stays with the consumer that
    cares.

    And the discharge counts AGAINST it, unclamped and identically on every
    site: only the site's own production can trigger Excess. Stored energy on
    its way out of the meter is not surplus - it is yesterday's surplus being
    sold, and an Excess load engaging on it would be charging a car from the
    house battery; stored energy serving the house or an engaged load is not
    surplus either, and it must count against the margin or an off-grid load
    out-drawing the charge allowance vouches for itself forever while the pack
    drains. See the term itself for the conservation identity that makes one
    signed subtraction cover every inverter work mode, grid-tied and off-grid
    alike.

    Every figure is read as the site would read it *with our own loads off* -
    that is what makes the number stable enough to decide with: a load that is
    running must not suppress the verdict that engaged it. Grid-tied, the
    feedback loop has already taken the draws off the grid readings, and the
    managed-draw term finishes the job by handing the freed power back to the
    battery's charge headroom (see the term itself); off-grid, where there are
    no readings at all, it is added wholesale.

    - where ``margin >= 0`` means Excess is on. The value is the excess pool in
    watts ONLY when read with ``hysteresis=0``: called with the latch's band it
    answers the verdict and overstates the pool by exactly that band, which is
    why ``_calculate_excess_available`` gates on one reading and sizes on the
    other. Callers need nothing else; the breakdown goes to the debug log.

    A sink contributes its allowance only while it can actually absorb:

    - **No grid** (off-grid site): export allowance is 0 - nothing can leave.
    - **No battery configured**, or **battery at/above its full SOC**: charge
      allowance is 0. A full battery draws no charge power, so leaving its rating
      in the allowance would make the sum unreachable exactly when the site is
      dumping the most energy.
    - **A battery being held below its rating**: the allowance is the rate it is
      PERMITTED to take, which is what ``site.battery_max_charge_power`` carries.
      Same principle as the full battery, one step short of it: while our own
      charge control holds an inverter's register at, say, 6.5 kW of a 10 kW
      rating - the PV clipping forecast reserving room for the afternoon - the
      missing 3.5 kW is not a place this site can put production either, and
      counting it would make the sum unreachable for the whole clipping window,
      which is precisely when the surplus Excess loads exist to soak up appears.
      Only actual enforcement narrows it; a battery merely *advised* a lower rate
      still charges at its rating. The engine assembles the number
      (``engine/fleet.charge_power_total``) - this stays one figure in watts.

    Zero counts as on, because it is the saturated case - export sitting at the
    allowance *and* the battery pulling its maximum charge rate is precisely
    "nothing more can be absorbed".

    ``hysteresis`` widens the band once Excess is engaged so a load doesn't
    chatter at the trigger point. It shrinks the allowance rather than shifting
    the margin, and the allowance is clamped at zero - otherwise a site with no
    allowance at all would report a pool larger than the power it actually has.

    A site with no allowance therefore sits exactly at 0: off-grid with a full
    battery. That is correct rather than degenerate - a full battery cannot take
    another watt, and an off-grid inverter in that state is curtailing. The loads
    that read the plain verdict do run there: the hot water tank's boost setpoint,
    a plug on its near-full trigger, and a modulating Excess load at its minimum
    current (a margin of 0 is a pool of 0, and the minimum is a floor while the
    verdict holds - see _source_limit). It self-corrects rather than self-limits:
    if production cannot cover them, the battery discharges, SOC falls below full,
    its charge allowance returns - and the discharge itself counts against the
    margin, so the verdict clears even when the engaged draws exceed the
    returned allowance. Without that term the correction was capped at the
    charge rate: any combined draw above it kept vouching for itself while the
    pack drained, and falling SOC never let go.

    The reconstruction itself - the export the site would read with our loads
    off, and the share of their freed power the battery would take - lives in
    ``_reconstruct_placement``, because the forecast's charge-limit advice
    steers on the same figures. The solar-only subtraction stays HERE rather
    than there: the advice steers the meter, so it wants the physical export,
    and a discharging pack is handled inside its own arithmetic.

    energy alone. That says nothing about the path: while the inverters are
    already putting out everything they are rated for, one more binary load
    cannot be served from the battery at all - its power comes from the grid
    (or, off-grid, pushes the inverters past their plate rating). This gate is
    the second half of the dual gate: SOC says there IS energy, this says the
    inverter can still deliver it. No rating configured (None/0) or no output
    reading → unlimited, the pre-gate behavior.

    **Evaluated with the load off** (issue #41's discipline - a gate a load's
    own draw can flip is a gate that suppresses itself). The load-off output is
    the current output minus the draws that would go away if this load, and
    everything it outranks, were shed:

    Two subtleties are why ``freed`` is not simply the shed draw:

    * **Grid import caps the add-back.** A draw the site is IMPORTING for is
      not part of what the inverters are delivering, so shedding it frees no
      inverter capacity. Without this cap, a load whose power comes from the
      grid while the inverters sit at their rating would credit itself with its
      own draw, the gate could never fail once the load was on, and issue #17
      would survive for every load that was already running when saturation
      arrived. When the site is EXPORTING the same term goes the other way and
      credits the export: that output is already on the AC bus and the load can
      have it by displacing it, no extra inverter capacity needed.
    * **Only outranked draws count.** Loads served BEFORE this one keep their
      share of the output (the distributor will not take it back), while loads
      this one outranks would be shed in its favour - so their draw is capacity
      this load may claim. Without this a running low-priority load would lock
      a higher-priority one out of a saturated inverter, undoing preemption.

    This gate is about the inverter's RATING only. Whether the energy exists at
    all stays the SOC gate's and the source pools' business.

    different question and a numerically terrible one. That slice is the
    residue of a 200:1 cancellation - ``grid[i] - (sum(grid) - total) / 3`` - so
    at a +50 W site margin each phase's share is ~0.07 A, arrived at by taking

An Excess load is refused on a phase that is BUYING - starting or already

    has turned around is not a momentary dip: it stays turned around until the
    household on it changes.

    The running carve-out that used to sit here was too generous. A tank that

    gives own-phase(s) against the remaining site total, with no divisor and no
    per-phase spreading of a claim that landed on one leg.
