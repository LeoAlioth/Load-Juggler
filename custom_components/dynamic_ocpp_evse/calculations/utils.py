    Off-grid the wiring changes nothing about what the output contains: with
    no grid for a parallel inverter to feed beside, everything the site
    consumes - our own loads included - comes out of the inverters. The
    parallel formula leans on the feedback loop having taken the draws off its
    grid terms; off-grid those are synthetic zeros it leaves alone, so the
    parallel household was the whole output and a charger's own draw was read
    as house load (a car meant to get 21.7 A settled at 10.9 A,
    dev/tests/test_offgrid_parallel_household.py).

    ``draws`` is the per-site-phase managed draw the series formula subtracts.
    The HA engine passes the SAME smoothed draw it subtracts everywhere else
    (``hub_calculation._managed_phase_draws``), because the inverter output it
    is subtracted from is smoothed too: a smoothed output minus a raw
    draw reads the household low for every cycle the output filter lags a
    charger's start. None sums every load's own reading - the single-cycle
    scenario runner, where there is no filter state for the two to disagree on.
