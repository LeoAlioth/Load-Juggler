    - AB, AC, BC: two-phase combination limits
    - ABC: three-phase (total) limit

    ``netting`` SAYS WHICH PHYSICS THE POOL OBEYS, and it travels with the pool
    rather than being passed at each call site, because ``deduct`` reaches
    ``normalize`` internally and a call-site flag could not steer that.

    * **Gross** (the default - grid, inverter, group, solar, physical): each
      phase's flow stands on its own, and a combination is bounded by its
      members. Right for a breaker, for what an inverter leg can deliver, and
      for an export LIMIT, which is contractual per exported flow - a site
      pushing 30 A out on two phases while pulling 10 A in on the third is
      exporting 30 A, not 20 A, and Slovenia meters it that way.
    * **Net** (the Excess pool): the total is the algebraic SUM, so an importing
      phase cancels an exporting one. Right for SURPLUS - with A and B importing
      1 A each and C exporting 2 A the site has nothing spare, so ``ABC`` is 0
      and a load on C may take nothing: taking C's 2 A would simply import.
      Under netting values stay signed and ``normalize``'s clamp-and-cascade is
      skipped. That cascade keeps a set of NON-NEGATIVE UPPER BOUNDS mutually
      consistent (``A <= AB`` and ``AB <= A + B``), which is what a gross pool
      holds. A net pool's fields are signed positions whose total is their
      algebraic sum, already consistent by construction, and clamping them at
      zero would throw away the very information the total is read from.

    ``get_available`` does NOT branch on the flag, and deliberately so. It once
    did, until the gross 1-phase rule was fixed to stop letting a two-phase
    field bound a load that is not on it (see below) - after which the two
    readings are provably identical: the remaining pair terms cannot bind,
    because ``(A + B) / 2 >= min(A, B)`` on a summed pool and
    ``total / 2 >= total / 3`` on a pooled one. Verified exhaustively over
    signed inputs. So the flag governs DEDUCTION and normalisation only, and a
