"""Forecast calibration - the pure arithmetic behind the two observers.

Two DIFFERENT forecast errors, measured separately because neither correction
fixes the other:

* **Level bias** - the forecast's daily energy is systematically high or low for
  an array: a wrong declared kWp, soiling, a horizon the model does not know,
  panel degradation. Stationary, so it is learnable as one slow gain per
  inverter. Measured as an energy-weighted ``actual ÷ forecast`` ratio.
* **Peakiness** - clipping is a convex, one-sided function of power, so by
  Jensen's inequality the clip of a block AVERAGE is never more than the average
  of the clip. A 15-minute series therefore understates clipping whenever power
  varies inside a block, and the forecast's mean can be exactly right while the
  clip is still too small. Measured by replaying real production samples
  against the block-average figure the forecast integral would have produced.

Both are OBSERVERS first: they publish what they would have corrected and change
nothing, so a season of evidence decides whether either is worth applying.

Pure functions - unit-testable.
