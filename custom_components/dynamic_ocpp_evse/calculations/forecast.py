"""PV clipping forecast - how much production the site cannot place.

Sites with more PV than they may export (e.g. 15 kWp behind a 5 kW export
limit) curtail the midday peak if the battery fills up in the morning. The
morning energy was never at risk - it could have been exported - so the site
should keep enough battery headroom for the forecast peak instead.

This module answers, from a solar production forecast: *how many kWh will be
produced above what the site can export or consume, and therefore how full may
the battery be right now?*

The threshold is ``T = grid export limit + base consumption`` - power the site
can place without curtailment. That is the ENERGY threshold, and it is used
only by the integral here: ``recommended_charge_limit``'s instantaneous advice
is memoryless direct feedback on measured battery power and meter export, and
never consults ``base_consumption`` at all (its docstring derives the form).
The forecast is a mapping of block-start
timestamps to average watts for that block (the ``watts`` attribute of the
Open-Meteo Solar Forecast sensors). Each block is treated as constant power
for its duration, so the maths is a plain sum over blocks:

    clipped_kwh    = Σ max(0, p − T) × h
    absorbable_kwh = Σ min(charge_cap, max(0, p − T)) × h

Block width ``h`` comes from consecutive timestamps - never assumed to be one
hour (Open-Meteo can serve 15-minute data, and DST makes one block two hours
wide). The block containing ``now`` is prorated, and blocks at or beyond
``until`` are excluded so one day's peak is never reserved for twice.

``until`` is one local day boundary, but not necessarily *tonight's*: the
reservation is measured against the NEXT clipping window, which is the
remainder of today while today still has clip left and tomorrow once it does
not (``select_clipping_window``). The lookahead stops there - see
``FORECAST_LOOKAHEAD_DAYS``.

A reservation for a window that is still a night away is not applied the moment
today's clip runs out: the published ceiling is a discharge FLOOR by the time
the write-control has fanned it out, so dropping it at dusk parks the battery at
the reserve and puts the house on the grid until dawn. It is held at the
destination and dropped just in time instead, against the forecast's own
``first_production_at`` - see ``reservation_is_due``.

``absorbable_kwh`` - the clipped energy the battery could physically take at
its charge rate - drives the SOC recommendation. The difference to
``clipped_kwh`` is unavoidable curtailment: energy no SOC ceiling can save,
because the *charge rate* is the binding constraint.

Deliberately not modelled: charge efficiency (≤6 %, and it errs conservative),
sub-hourly cloud transients (block resolution makes the estimate a lower
bound), and multi-hump days, where reserving for the whole remaining tail can
over-reserve between the humps.

Pure functions - unit-testable. Timezone handling lives in the caller; these
take timezone-aware datetimes and never consult a clock.

    The published ceiling is a DISCHARGE FLOOR once the SOC write-control fans it
    out, so a reserve applied at dusk empties the pack to the reserve by early
    evening and then puts the house on the grid until dawn. The battery has to
    arrive at the reserve, but only by the time production starts - every hour it
    spends above the reserve before that is an hour it serves the house for free.

        time until production  <=  hours to shed × FORECAST_EARLY_START_FACTOR

    The factor biases the drop EARLY, and deliberately so - the two errors are
    not symmetric. Arriving too full costs real clipped kilowatt-hours at the
    peak, which is the whole reason the reserve exists; arriving early costs
    nothing at all, because the pack simply sits at the reserve for the last
    stretch of the night exactly as it would have all evening under the naive
    rule. Note that a factor GREATER than one moves the drop earlier: the shed is
    given more hours than it needs.

    Four answers are settled before the arithmetic, in this order:

    * **Production is not ahead of us** (``production_at`` is None or already
      reached) - daylight, or a forecast with nothing to schedule against. Due,
      and nothing latched: there is no night here to be part-way through.
    * **Already dropped this night** (``was_due``) - see the latch below.
    * **No SOC** - HOLD at the destination. The drop is an action taken on a
      number we do not have; inventing one to evict a battery is the one mistake
      that cannot be undone by the next cycle.
    * **No usable estimate** (``hours_to_shed`` is None - no capacity, no base
      consumption) or **nothing to shed** (the pack is already at or below the
      reserve): due immediately. That is the plain pre-scheduling behaviour, and
      it is the safe degraded mode - it can only make the battery arrive early.

    Returns ``(due, latched)``, and the caller carries ``latched`` back in as
    ``was_due``. They differ in exactly one case, which is what makes the latch
    self-clearing: while production is under way the answer is "due" but nothing
    is latched, so the state is clean again by dusk and the next night starts
    from scratch. No date arithmetic, no persisted schedule.

    The latch is not optional. Once the floor drops the pack discharges, and if
    it discharges FASTER than base consumption ``hours_to_shed`` shrinks faster
    than the clock does, so the plain inequality flips back to false and the
    recommendation would climb back to the destination in the middle of the
    night - re-raising a floor the inverter has already acted on. Latched, the
    drop stands until production starts, whatever the pack does in between: it
    survives the SOC reaching the reserve early (the floor holds it there and the
    house moves to the grid, exactly as intended), an SOC sensor dropping out
    afterwards, and the forecast entity going unavailable.

    anyway - clamped to ``[soc_floor, 100]``. With nothing to absorb

    The anchor is the destination rather than a flat 100 % because the reserve

      the buffer that catches a day the forecast under-read; a battery allowed
      to run past it at the BMS's own rate has spent that buffer before the sun
      could ask for it. This is a STANDING ceiling, so it does not depend on a
      clip being forecast - on a day whose production never reaches the export
      limit the surplus is 0 and the pack simply parks at the destination on
      the configured minimum floor, while a day that genuinely makes more than
      the site can place lets it climb on that surplus alone (and an engaged
      Excess load displaces it watt for watt, see ``excess_draw_w``).
    - **below the destination with nothing left to clip** (``absorbable_kwh <=
      0``) → full rate, and the latch drops immediately: under the ceiling, with
      no reserve to protect, refilling is exactly what should happen.
    - **below the destination with a clip forecast** → the reservation's SOC band
      (see below): full rate under it, and inside it charge only with power that
      could not have been exported.

    The order is load-bearing, and getting it wrong was the live bug of
    2026-08-25: with ``absorbable_kwh <= 0`` tested FIRST, a site whose day was
    forecast to clip nothing ran clean through its 95 % destination to 98 % at
    the BMS's full rate. That early return was correct when this function's
    ceiling was always 100 % - there was no destination to cross - and became
    wrong the moment the reserve was anchored at where the battery is heading.

    THE ENGAGED VALUE IS MEMORYLESS DIRECT FEEDBACK, and this is the whole
    controller:

        desired = battery_charge_now + (export_now − export_setpoint)

    Read it as the site's own power balance rearranged. Whatever the battery is
    absorbing right now is holding that much off the meter, so permitting
    ``battery + error`` is exactly the rate at which the meter would land on the
    setpoint - one step, from this cycle's two measurements, with no state
    between cycles at all. ``export_setpoint_w`` is watts AT THE METER
    (``export limit − Excess trigger margin``), never a production threshold:
    the setpoint is the export this site wants to ride at, a margin under its
    limit so an Excess load has something to trigger on and so a hard-limiting
    inverter is never the thing deciding the value.

    Memoryless is the point. The design this replaced anchored the value on
    forecast-independent FEEDFORWARD (``max(0, production − (limit − margin +
    base))``) and corrected the standing ``(base − house)`` error with a slow
    integral trim. Feedforward through ``base_consumption`` is a guess about the
    house, and the trim that fixed the guess was state: a cloud, a kettle or a
    car meant a correction earned under a plant that no longer existed, carried
    into the next regime. Measured against the bounded-trim design over a cloudy
    household day, this form curtails ~62 Wh where that one curtails ~370 Wh,
    and its whole cost is register traffic (~54 writes a day against ~31), which
    ``control/inverter.py`` pays for with directional pacing rather than with
    memory in here. ``base_consumption`` survives only in the forecast INTEGRAL,
    which is an energy question about a whole day and where it is exact.

    ``battery_charge_w`` is positive CHARGING - the negation of
    ``SiteContext.battery_power``'s convention, and the caller does that
    negation. A DISCHARGING pack therefore makes the term negative, which is
    correct rather than defensive: a charge cap cannot force a discharge, so
    when the arithmetic asks for one the clamp at 0 is the honest answer and no
    freeze rule is needed. A site with no battery-power sensor hands in 0 and
    gets the conservative degradation - the engaged value is then the export
    error alone, so a genuine surplus is admitted only as fast as the meter
    shows it.

    The masked site needs no special case either, which is what makes this form
    safe on a hard-limiting inverter. With export pinned at the wall,
    ``export_now`` IS the limit, so the value returned is
    ``battery + (limit − setpoint) = battery + margin``: the permit self-creeps
    by one Excess trigger margin per cycle until export falls off the limit,
    from where the plain feedback tracks the sun. That is the same escape the
    shifted anchor bought, and here it is a consequence of the setpoint sitting
    a margin below the limit rather than a second threshold to keep in step.

    The reservation's SOC test is a two-threshold LATCH, not one boundary, which
    is why the caller must hand the previous state back in as ``was_limiting``:

    - disarmed → engage at ``battery_soc >= max_soc − hysteresis_pct``
    - engaged  → release only below ``max_soc − 2 × hysteresis_pct``

    A single threshold in both directions was a genuine bug: the cap suppresses
    the very charging that pushed SOC over the boundary, so an integer SOC
    sitting on it flapped engage/release every couple of minutes and each flip
    became a Modbus/EEPROM register write. With the band a full
    ``hysteresis_pct`` wide, an integer ±1 tick at either threshold cannot flip
    the gate. ``max_soc`` moving (a forecast refresh) needs no special case -
    the same rule is applied against the new ceiling.

    ``at_destination`` is a latch of the same shape at a different boundary
    (``yields_to_excess``: engage exactly at the destination, release a full
    ``hysteresis_pct`` below it), and the two engagement sources compose into the
    ONE ``limiting`` state this returns. That is deliberate rather than
    convenient: whenever a clip IS forecast the reserved ceiling sits at or below
    the destination, so a battery at the destination is inside the reservation's
    band too and both sources agree - and when the destination hold lets go a
    band lower, ``was_limiting`` is exactly the state the reservation's own
    release threshold wants to be judged against, so a clip that appeared while
    the pack was parked takes over the hold without a step in the advice.

    Unknown SOC is left where it always sat, at the reservation: no reading is no
    destination crossing to detect either (``yields_to_excess`` is False without
    an SOC), so nothing-to-clip plus no SOC is still full rate. A dead SOC sensor
    must not strand the pack on the floor for the rest of the day, and a
    reservation that IS at risk still protects itself the way it did before.

    One engaged-only adjustment rides on top of the feedback value, and it does
    not exist while the gate is released (full rate is full rate):

    * ``excess_draw_w`` - what the site's engaged Excess loads are already
      drawing, subtracted only when the caller says the battery is above its
      destination and therefore the absorber of last resort (the same
      ``yields_to_excess`` latch that arrives here as ``at_destination``; the
      caller passes 0 below it). An Excess EVSE then displaces battery charging
      watt for watt; with nothing engaged, or nothing able to absorb, the
      battery goes on taking the whole surplus toward 100 % exactly as before.
      0 below the destination, where the battery is served first. It is
      subtracted rather than left to the feedback because the reconstruction
      credits those draws back into ``reconstructed_export_w`` on purpose (a
      load that is running must not suppress the verdict that engaged it), so
      without this term the battery and the car would both be permitted the
      same watts.

    Returns ``(limit_w, limiting)``. The limit is always a legitimate setpoint
    ("restricted" is exactly ``limit_w < battery_max_charge_power``); the flag
    is the latch state to carry into the next cycle.
