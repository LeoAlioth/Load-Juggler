"""Config-entry relationship lookups (hub ↔ loads / inverters / groups).

The integration's entries form a tree: one hub entry per site, with load,
inverter and circuit-group entries pointing at it via ``CONF_HUB_ENTRY_ID``.
These helpers are the single place that walks that tree, for anything that
needs "the hub of this load" or "the inverters of this hub".

Deliberately free of any runtime ``homeassistant`` import - the HA types are
annotations only, under ``TYPE_CHECKING``. That is what lets this module live
outside the package root: it used to sit in ``__init__.py``, where every
caller in ``engine/``, ``entities/`` and ``config_flow.py`` had to defer its
import to function scope to dodge the circular dependency back through the
HA-importing package root.
