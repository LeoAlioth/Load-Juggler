"""HA-layer tests for the portable power station device type.

Machine-authored tests - not yet human-reviewed.

Covers the two halves that need Home Assistant to exercise: the engine builder
(_build_power_station_load - bounds, managed draw, status) and the command
module (send_power_station_command - what gets written to which entity). The pure
resolvers are covered in test_power_station.py.

Run under WSL/Linux with pytest-homeassistant-custom-component; HA core needs
fcntl, so these do not collect on macOS.
