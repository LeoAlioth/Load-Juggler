"""Tests for the portable power station device type.

Machine-authored tests - not yet human-reviewed.

Two pure resolvers carry the device type's logic. The station's charge-speed knob
has no zero (200 W floor), so the engine's allocation decides *how fast* and the
backup reserve decides *whether*: dropped below the current battery level, the
station stops drawing from the wall and serves its own loads from its battery.
