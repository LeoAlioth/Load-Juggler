"""Contract guards against the "read an entity, forget its unit" bug class.

Machine-authored tests - not yet human-reviewed.

test_units.py checks the converters. These two check that the converters are
actually *reached*, which is where the real bugs were:

1. Every unit the config flow accepts for a field must be declared in
   ENTITY_UNIT_CONTRACTS and must genuinely convert into that field's
   canonical domain. Adding a field that accepts millivolts without teaching
   units.py about millivolts fails here rather than in production.

2. No new hand-rolled ``float(state.state)`` parsing. Each one of those is a
   place where a unit can be forgotten - the grid-phase reader was exactly
   that, for months, while the config flow advertised "A or W, auto-converted".
   New occurrences must either go through units.py or be added to the
   allowlist below with a reason.

Both work by reading the source, so they cover code no runtime test touches.
