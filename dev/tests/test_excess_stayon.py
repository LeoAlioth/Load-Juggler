"""The Excess stay-on rule - calculations.excess_margin under a running load.

Machine-authored tests - not yet human-reviewed.

ISSUES.md #41. The rule: *if turning a load off would re-trigger Excess, it
stays on.* Mechanically that is one identity -

    margin read while the load runs == margin the same site would read with
    the load switched off

- and it must hold no matter HOW the inverter served the load: by exporting
less, or by charging the battery less. Where it failed, an engaged load
suppressed the very verdict that engaged it and the relay cycled every cycle.

These tests build the *physical* meter readings for a running load, push them
through the real reconstruction the engine applies (``grid_without_managed_draws``,
the pure core of ``_apply_feedback_loop``) and compare the margin against the
same site with the load off. The identity is the assertion; the individual
numbers are only there to show the sums.
