"""The battery charge control, as a CLOSED LOOP through the production code.

Machine-authored tests - not yet human-reviewed.

Everything else about this controller is tested a piece at a time: the value in
``test_forecast_clipping.py``, the engine wiring in ``test_sensor_update.py``,
the register rules in ``test_inverter_control.py``. What none of those can show
is the behaviour that only exists when the loop is closed - the advice moving
the register, the register moving the battery, the battery moving the meter, and
the meter deciding the next advice.

So this rig runs the real cycle against a plant:

    battery = min(register, production − house − load draw, room left)
    measured = min(potential, export limit + house + battery + draw)

The second line is the site the design exists for: an inverter that HARD-ENFORCES
the export limit by curtailing its own PV, so production is masked while export
sits on the wall and ``curtailed`` is the energy the site threw away. Every
figure below is measured off that - no monkeypatches, no stand-in for
``recommended_charge_limit`` or ``send_inverter_charge_limit``, the same
``run_hub_calculation`` → per-inverter advice → real ``number.set_value`` path
production takes once per site cycle.

The rows here are the ones the design was chosen on (six rounds of head-to-head
experiments, worktree-only): a cloudy household day, a burst train, a kettle, a
cloud, an evening ramp-down, an Excess load taking the surplus, and the gate
engaging.
