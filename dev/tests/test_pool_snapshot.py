"""The pool snapshot - what the Overview page and the diagnostics dump show.

Machine-authored tests - not yet human-reviewed.

Every watt figure the publisher shows for a pool is RE-DERIVED from the site's
headroom terms: ``available_grid_power``, ``available_solar_power`` and the
rest are computed a second time in ``engine/hub_result.py`` from
``grid_headroom``, ``solar_available`` and friends. The allocator meanwhile
works from three ``PhaseConstraints`` objects built in
``calculations/target_calculator.py``. Two derivations of the same quantity is
two chances to be right, and through the Excess over-commitment of 2026-09-07
they were not: the page reported a surplus the distribution never saw.

``SiteContext.pool_snapshot`` closes that by publishing the pools THEMSELVES -
per phase, per combination, with the basis flag - so a dump answers "what did
the allocator actually have?" instead of "what would this arithmetic say?".

Two things about it are easy to misread, and both are pinned below:

* **The basis.** The Excess pool nets (an importing phase cancels an exporting
  one); every other pool is gross (each phase's flow stands alone). The same
  seven fields mean different things under each, so the flag travels with the
  snapshot.
* **"Left" is measured, not permitted.** The pools are deducted by each load's
  real footprint (``_pool_deduction``), so an untouched pool beside a granted
  permit is the normal reading for an idle plug - not a missed deduction.
