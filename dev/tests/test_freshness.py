"""Unit tests for the producer-freshness predicate - entities/freshness.py.

Machine-authored tests - not yet human-reviewed.

Load Juggler's sensors are readers: the value they show was produced by their
hub's site cycle, not by themselves. So "is this sensor available?" is really
"did the producer publish recently?", and this module is that question reduced
to arithmetic - no Home Assistant, no entity, no hass.data.

What the tests pin:
  * the window is max(30 s, 3 x cycle) - the floor protects a fast site from
    flapping, the multiplier lets a slow one miss a tick;
  * never-updated (None) is stale, which is what makes a sensor unavailable
    before the first cycle instead of publishing a 0 that reads as real;
  * a garbage cycle length degrades to the 30 s floor rather than to "always
    stale" - one bad option must not blank out an entire site;
  * a future timestamp counts as fresh, so a clock step cannot black out every
    sensor on the site.
