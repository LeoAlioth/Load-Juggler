"""The dual gate on SOC-gated binary loads - SOC *and* inverter coverage.

Machine-authored tests - not yet human-reviewed.

ISSUES.md #17, reversed from "accepted by design" to a fix. A battery-backed
plug in Solar Priority / Solar Only / Excess is switched on by an SOC verdict
alone: *there is stored energy*. That says nothing about the PATH. While the
inverters already put out everything they are rated for, the plug's power cannot
come from the battery - it comes from the grid (or, off grid, pushes the
inverters past their plate rating). ``_source_limit`` now also requires the
inverter's rating to cover the load's own draw.

The gate is evaluated **with the load off** (ISSUES.md #41's discipline): a gate
the load's own draw can flip is a gate that suppresses itself. What makes that
add-back honest is the grid term - a draw the site is IMPORTING for is not
something the inverters are delivering, so shedding it frees no inverter
capacity. That single term is the difference between a gate that sheds a
grid-fed load and a one-way latch that can never shed anything once it is on.
