    The scenarios' own ``expected`` blocks say what each site should allocate.
    These say what NO site may ever do, whatever it was written to test, and
    they are the half that catches a bug nobody thought to write a scenario
    for. Both are stated against the physical inputs the CT simulation was
    built from (household, solar, battery), not against the engine's own view
    of them - checking the engine against its own reconstruction would only
    prove it is self-consistent, which every bug in this class already was.

    **A - the breaker.** With the permits just issued actually drawn, no phase
    may exceed ``main_breaker_rating``.

    **B - a modulating Excess load may never cause import.** Recompute the
    site's position with those loads' permits removed: if removing them turns
    import into less import, the engine sized them on surplus that was not
    there. Restricted to ``BEHAVIOR_EXCESS`` on purpose - it is the one
    behaviour the engine SIZES against a surplus pool, so it has no excuse.
    Binary Excess loads are exempt by decision (Anže, 2026-09-07: a 2 kW
    element on a smaller surplus still boosts, because the overshoot costs
    export), and Solar Priority is exempt because it deliberately runs on a
    grid-backed minimum below the SOC target.

    **C - off-grid, our loads stay inside the battery and the inverter.** With
    no grid the pack covers every deficit (see ``simulate_grid_ct``), so an
    over-allocation shows up as the battery discharging past its rating, or
    below the SOC floor, and as the inverter delivering past its own. Measured
    against the site with every managed load off: our loads may take the pack
    up to its discharge rating while the SOC is at/above its minimum and not at
    all below it, and the inverter up to its rating - never past what the house
    alone already asks of either.
