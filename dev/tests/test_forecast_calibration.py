"""Forecast calibration arithmetic - calculations/calibration.py.

Two observers, two different errors. The tests that matter are the ones pinning
WHY each measurement is shaped the way it is: energy-weighting rather than a
mean of ratios, constrained intervals excluded rather than whole days, and the
peakiness gap measured from real samples rather than modelled.
