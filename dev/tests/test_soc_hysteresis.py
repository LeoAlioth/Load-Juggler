"""The battery SOC hysteresis latch - engine/hub_calculation._apply_soc_hysteresis.

The latch widens a threshold once it has been crossed so the SOC-gated modes
cannot chatter around it. Its answer has to agree with the gates that consume
it, and on the MIN floor it did not: the latch read "still above" at exactly the
floor while ``_source_limit`` read "not above" and shed the load, so the band
never armed. Observed live 2026-08-29 on an off-grid site: a 3.6 kW plug in
Solar Priority cycled 58 times in ten hours in a 1% SOC window at the floor,
until the car plugged into it locked its onboard charger out.

The contract, from the function's own docstring: discharge stops AT the
configured floor and resumes only a full hysteresis above it.
