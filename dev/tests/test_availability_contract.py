"""Contract guards for "is this sensor reading usable?" - ISSUES.md #31.

Machine-authored tests - not yet human-reviewed.

That question used to be hand-rolled at more than a dozen read sites with five
different answers, and they drifted: some forgot ``state.state is None``, some
forgot the empty string, one forgot both. The membership now lives once, in
``units.UNAVAILABLE_STATES``, reached through ``units.is_unavailable`` (state
objects), ``units.is_unavailable_state`` (a status carried onward as a bare
string) and ``units.state_or_unknown`` (the stand-in when there is no state
object at all). ``units.is_unusable_number`` answers the separate, later
question of whether a parsed reading can be used as a number.

The bug that motivated all of it was the grid CTs. ``_read_grid_phases`` coerced
an unavailable reading to **0 A** and trusted a second, independently
hand-rolled staleness test downstream to overwrite it. 0 A on a grid phase means
"the house is importing nothing", i.e. the whole main breaker is free - so any
divergence between those two tests, in either direction, silently granted full
breaker headroom on a blind site. The reader now propagates its sentinel and
``_resolve_grid_phases`` is the only thing allowed to substitute a value, which
is what the middle section here pins down.

    time-based the fast half was carried along as a RATIO against it
    (``alpha * (0.8 / 0.3)``, capped at 1). A ratio is not a filter speed and
    does not hold one: capped, it pinned at 1.0 from a 3 s cadence upward, so
    the fast half passed its input straight through while the slow half went on
    filtering. That is precisely the two-readings-to-converge damping the 0.8
    was calibrated to get, absent on every site slower than the default. At 1 s
    the same ratio was too SLOW (0.436 where the real lag gives 0.553).

    Asserted as a property: at each cadence the fast weight must be the one
    CTRL_FAST_TAU_S implies, and must stay faster than the slow weight, which
    is the whole point of the pair."""
