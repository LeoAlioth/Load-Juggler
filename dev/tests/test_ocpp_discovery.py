"""OCPP charger discovery - device-registry driven, not entity-name guessing.

The scan used to take one ``sensor.*_current_import`` entity_id, strip the
suffix off it and guess every sibling as ``sensor.{base}{suffix}``. These tests
pin the replacement: siblings are found through the device the ocpp integration
created, and the charge point id - the only handle its services accept - is
read off the device-registry identifier it stamps.

Every case here is one the old prefix guess got wrong or could not see at all,
plus the contract cases (payload key set, watts-only chargers, the
already-configured filter) that must survive the change untouched.
