"""Tests for the inverter battery write-controls - control.inverter.

Machine-authored tests - not yet human-reviewed.

Two controls, one contract each.

The forecast's recommended **charge limit** only reaches the inverter when the
user armed the control switch, the value moved by more than the deadband, and
the write interval has elapsed. Releasing puts the normal value back exactly
once.

The recommended **max SOC** is fanned out across every configured time-of-use
slot, each with its own deadband, and is always ``min(normal, recommendation)``
- so it has no release event at all, and the "normal" side is a live entity that
external automations keep owning. Its section is further down the file.

**Who calls this** changed and these tests did not have to: the control used to
be ticked by the charge-control sensor's 10 s platform poll, and is now awaited
once per site cycle (default 2 s) as a site-cycle worker - see
``entities/mixins.SiteCycleWorkerMixin``. The pacing is wall-clock, so the two
cadences are the same contract; the section at the bottom drives the control at
both of them and pins that. The entity-level half of the change (registration
with the hub's worker bucket, the write happening through the real coordinator
cycle, and ``async_update`` no longer writing) lives in ``test_sensor_update.py``
where the HA fixtures are, with source-level guards for it here.

# forecast ceiling self-healed upward (98 → 99 → 100 % as the clip burned down)
# the latch disarmed, the release wrote the full normal value in ONE step, and
# the battery drank ~10 kW out of exportable power for ten minutes - the
# clipping reserve spent on exactly the energy it was being kept for, ahead of
# the peak it was kept for.
#
# The release SEMANTICS were right ("less reserve needed, you may refill"); the
# step response was the defect. So the written value may climb by at most one
# Excess trigger margin's worth of watts per write, converted into the target
# register's own units, while a DOWNWARD move - engaging the limit, the
# protection direction - still lands in a single write.
