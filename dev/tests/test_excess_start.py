"""The Excess start edge - what a modulating Excess load is granted.

Machine-authored tests - not yet human-reviewed.

The rule: *the verdict starts the FIRST load, the pool only sizes it.* A
modulating load (an EVSE) cannot run below its minimum current, so while Excess
is engaged its minimum IS the floor - held there while the momentary pool is
smaller than it, followed upward once the pool exceeds it. That is the start
edge the binary Excess loads (plug, tank boost) have always had: they engage on
threshold-hit even though their whole rating overshoots the pool.

Behind the first consumer, Excess loads start IN RANK ORDER: each one only
while the surplus left after the higher-ranked loads' claims (their permits,
not their not-yet-measured draws) is still positive. It need not cover the
load's own minimum - 500 W left after a 2.1 kW tank still starts a 1.4 kW EVSE
at its floor - but nothing left means it waits, and a running one yields. Two
2 kW steps no longer engage together on a 300 W surplus and flap (the EcoFlow +
boiler site, 2026-09-03).

Gating the start on the pool instead leaves a modulating load at 0 forever on
the site the pool is smallest at: with our charge control tracking the export
overshoot the standing margin sits AT the trigger - a pool of 0 amps, which is
Excess by definition (nothing more can be absorbed) - peaking only between
register writes.

The floor is a floor on the *Excess allocation*, not a licence to overrun
physical limits: the wire, the phase and a circuit-group breaker still stop a
load that cannot be given its minimum. The last three tests are that boundary.

Release is not this file's subject - the latch's hysteresis on the reconstructed
margin owns it (see test_excess_stayon.py).
