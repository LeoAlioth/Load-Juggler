"""Tests for the Excess trigger - calculations.excess_margin.

Machine-authored tests - not yet human-reviewed.

Excess means the site can no longer place its own production anywhere else. One
number decides it for every Excess-mode load:

    margin = (grid export + battery charge power + our Excess-tier draws)
           - (export allowance + battery charge allowance - hysteresis)

A load ranked above the Excess tier is not handed back: its draw is production
the site has already placed (see the outranking section at the end).

``margin >= 0`` means Excess is on. The value is the excess pool in watts only when
read with ``hysteresis=0`` - with the latch's band it answers the VERDICT and
overstates the pool by that band (see _calculate_excess_available). A
sink contributes its allowance only while it can actually absorb - no grid means
no export allowance, and no battery (or a full one) means no charge allowance.
The measured battery discharge counts against the absorbed side, unclamped and
identically on every site, so a draw served by stored energy can never hold the
verdict it engaged on - off-grid, where export is always 0, that makes the
margin the load-off surplus by conservation.
