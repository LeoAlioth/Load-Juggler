"""Tests for the inverter fleet aggregation - engine.fleet.

Machine-authored tests - not yet human-reviewed.

Many inverter entries reduce to the single-inverter/single-battery scalars
SiteContext expects. The per-member gating the scalar form cannot express
happens here: charge capacity excludes members whose OWN battery is at its
OWN full-SOC; discharge capacity excludes members below the hub minimum;
fleet SOC is capacity-weighted; solar sums parallel outputs plus series
outputs minus their own battery power. With a single member every aggregate
must reduce to exactly the classic singleton value.

Runnable two ways:
